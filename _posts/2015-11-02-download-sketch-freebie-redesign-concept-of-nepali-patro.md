I feel we, as designers, should give back to the community while we’re still learning a lot from it. Here’s one more to the attempt :)

Today, I’m releasing a redesign concept of Nepali Patro (for Android). I completed the redesign in last two days. The concept is in [Devnagari](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Devanagari), a script used to write Nepali.

<!--more-->

[Nepali Patro](http://nepalipatro.com.np/) is an app that offers Nepali Calendar with important dates for festivals and cultural activities. Nepali calendar is based on traditional [Bikram Sambat Calendar](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vikram_Samvat).

Disclaimer: I am not related to the original makers of Nepali Patro. This is just my attempt to redesign the popular app.

###Screens/ Flow of the app
I made some changes to the flow of the app compared to the existing Nepali Patro app. Ive divided the flow into 4major tasks/ screens: आज (Today), पात्र (Calendar), राशिफल (Horoscope) and मिति रुपान्तरण (Date converter). I’ve tried to keep the flow as simple as possible and have stripped some of the navigations. For instance, Today screen only provides the information about today.

Calendar screen provides monthly view of a year. The months are swipable horizontally. The important dates are circled. Below the calendar is a list of important dates’ detail that month. Tapping on any of the important dates takes the user to that date in the list below. Ive taken the Date Converter out from the navigation and put it in the calendar section. I felt converter sounds logical in the Calendar. This can also act as a separate widget. Horoscope has a tabbed interface which is scrollable horizontally.

The design is based on 8px grid as specified in [Material Design Guidelines](https://www.google.com/design/spec/layout/metrics-keylines.html#) by Google. Press Ctrl+G to enable grid in the design.
